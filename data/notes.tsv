1844	1843	1855	5	The potato famine (1845-1852) leads to a huge increase in Irish immigration.  During the famine, Irish immigrants account for almost half the new immigrant populations.  By 1855, however, Irish immigration has begun to decrease dramatically, and 1865, Irish immigrants are barely 20% of the immigrant population.
1864	1863	1867	6	The Contract Labor Law allows for the recruitment of laborers from overseas.  With industrialization beginning, immigration is unregulated and workers begin seeking opportunities in the growing American market.
1882	1878	1885	2.7	The Chinese Exclusion Act suspends Chinese immigration.  Immigration is becoming more regulated, with other federal immigration restrictions around the corner (such as the Alien Contract Labor Law in 1885 that prevents overseas contracting).
1898	1897	1908	2	Ellis Island has been open since 1982 and the steamship has made the trip to the United States faster and more affordable.  Angel Island is only a few years away on the West Coast, and the ground is laid for the upcoming immigration boom.
1907	1907	1910	2	The Gentleman's Agreement of 1907 between Japan and the US prevents further Japanese immigration.  A federal law also places more restrictions on Ellis Island immigrants, as the immigration station was reaching record numbers of immigrant arrivals â€“ over 11,000 each day.  Immigrants now must be in good health, without disabilities, and all children needed to be accompanied by an adult. 
1912	1910	1915	2	WWI slows immigration rates dramatically.
1914	1912	1918	2	Nativism and xenophobia among non-immigrant populations lead to increased restrictions on immigrants.  The 1907 Congressional Commission on immigration stated that most immigrant populations could not assimilate well and immigration was not good for Americans or the migrating peoples.  By 1917, laws are passed requiring immigrants to pass English literacy tests, and further restrictions on Asian immigration are made.
1921	1920	1923	2.5	The Quota Act of 1921 brings a new attitude towards restricting immigration.  European immigration is capped at about 350,000 immigrants per year, and Asian immigrant caps are placed at or near zero.
1924	1923	1925	2.5	The Immigration Act of 1924 brings more changes and regulations.  The quota system continues, but the quotas are now defined as 2% of the number of foreign-born persons of a certain nationality residing in the United States before the immigration boom.  Using data from 1890, the new quotas restricted immigration even further.
1952	1950	1954	5.5	The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 paves the road for a steady increase in immigration.  It retains the quota system based on nationality, and President Truman initially vetos the bill, as he felt it encouraged the same xenophobia that the quotas in the 20's promoted.  The new system's quotas no longer completely bars Asian immigration, and grants Japan and other Asian nations low (but existing) quotas.  Asian and Central/South American immigration rates begin to slowly increase.
1965	1965	1967	6	The steady increase continues, as the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 changes immigrant quotas to now be based on skills and familial connection to U.S. citizens or residents, rather than nationality.
1988	1986	1991	1.6	The Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 enables many illegal immigrants, primarily from Mexico, as well as other Latin American and Asian countries, to obtain citizenship and enables the incoming spike in legal Latin American immigration.
1991	1991	1998	1.6	The Immigrantion Act of 1990 increased total immigrant caps significantly, driving a huge spike in immigration, almost half of which is from Latin American countries, and nearly a third from Asian nations.
2006	2003	2008	4	New immigration laws seeking to reform immigration policies and decrease illegal immigration are proposed, but do not become law.  The Border Protection, Anit-Terrorism and Illegal Immigration Control Act sought to increase penalties for illegal immigration, but was greeted with heavy protesting from many Spanish-speaking immigrant communities and immigration supporters.
